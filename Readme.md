# Revised Skill Descriptions for paw·ned²

Some skills behave notably different from their in-game descriptions. This repository provides revised descriptions for these skills for use in the popular build editor paw·ned².

## Installation

Simply copy all files, except for this document, into your `skilldata` directory. Typically this will be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\paw·ned²\skilldata`. Close and reopen paw·ned² and you'll be able to select "English, revised descriptions (PvE)" from the flag dropdown.

## Limitations

Only skills whose inaccuracies are relevant as judged by myself, and whose inaccuracies can reasonably be added to their description, have been modified. In particular, skill descriptions that mention "health gain" instead of "healing" (or vice versa) haven't been updated. Many thanks to the countless wiki contributors who researched and documented all these [skill bugs](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/List_of_bugs#Skills) and [skill anomalies](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/List_of_anomalies#Skills).

Only skills that behave differently from their in-game descriptions as judged by myself, and whose inaccuracies could be reasonably added to their description, have been modified. If we revised every description that mentioned "health gain" instead of "healing", we'd be here all day. Many thanks to the countless wiki users who researched and documented inaccuracies.

The anniversary elite skills are defined in a DLL file instead of the usual skill CSVs. We can't edit them. Notably, [Together as One](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/%22Together_as_One!%22) has a greater range than described and affects other pets.
